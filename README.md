# 2-Tier-Web-App-v2.0

Basic 2-Tier Web App implemented using Java, HTML, and CSS. It runs using Apache Tomcat webserver. This project uses an Apache Tomcat server to take a user's first and last name. There is a text file which includes the names allowed. The names entered are validated from the file and a success or failure to login page is shown.

I have uploaded all the files. The folder structure for an Apache Tomcat webapp is not followed here.

This is the second and more refined frontend version of the first version web app I made. Hence, the name 'v2.0'.
